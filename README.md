# Traffic-Simulation
PJAS 2021 Project on Measuring Impact of Autonomous Systems on Congestion (Won Best CS Project)

This project aimed to create a traffic grid simulation that could be tweaked so that cars knew each other's locations and could dynamically re-route themselves as well as testing the use of smart traffic lights that weren't stuck on a fixed cycle and could change to allow more throughput.

## The four folders run simulations with slightly different parameters:

### TS-Cars
Runs the simulation with the cars networked and talking to each other so they can take longer routes in order to avoid congestion

### TS-Lights
Runs the simulation with the lights dynamically switching so that the most cars can pass through in the same amount of time

### TS-Lights-Cars
Runs the simulation with both the networked cars and the smart lights
